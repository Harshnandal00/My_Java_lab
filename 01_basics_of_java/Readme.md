# Java Lab Programs

This repository contains all Java programs, exercises, and lab assignments completed as part of my college curriculum.
It serves both as a personal reference for practice and as a structured collection of solutions for academic lab work.

## 🚀 How to Run Programs

### Using VS Code:
1. Open the repository folder in VS Code.
2. Install **Java Extension Pack** if not already installed.
3. Open the `.java` file you want to run.
4. Click the **Run** button above the `main()` method or press `Ctrl + F5`.

### Using Command Prompt:
1. Navigate to the folder containing the `.java` file.
2. Compile the program:
```bash
javac FileName.java

Run the program:

java FileName

Replace FileName with the class name containing the main method.

📌 Key Notes

All code follows Java 25 (LTS) standards.

Variable names and coding style are consistent for readability.

Programs are modular and commented to improve understanding.

.gitignore ensures compiled files and VS Code settings are excluded from version control.
